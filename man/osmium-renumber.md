# NAME

osmium-renumber - renumber object IDs


# SYNOPSIS

**osmium renumber** \[*OPTIONS*\] *INPUT-FILE*


# DESCRIPTION

The objects (nodes, ways, and relations) in an OSM file often have very large
IDs. This can make some kinds of postprocessing difficult. This command will
renumber all objects using IDs starting at 1. Referential integrity will be
kept.

This command can only be run on OSM files sorted in the usual way (nodes first,
then ways, then IDs). It will read the input file twice, so it will not work
with STDIN.

This command needs quite a bit of main memory to keep the mapping between old
and new IDs. It is intended for small extracts. Don't try to run this on a full
planet!

You must never upload the data generated by this command to OSM! This would
really confuse the OSM database because it knows the objects under different
IDs.


# OPTIONS

-f, --output-format=FORMAT
:   The format of the output file. Can be used to set the output file format
    if it can't be autodetected from the output file name.
    **See osmium-file-formats**(5) or the libosmium manual for details.

-F, --input-format=FORMAT
:   The format of the input file. Can be used to set the input format if it
    can't be autodetected from the file name. See **osmium-file-formats**(5)
    or the libosmium manual for details.

--generator=NAME
:   The name and version of the program generating the output file. It will be
    added to the header of the output file. Default is "*osmium/*" and the version
    of osmium.

-o, --output=FILE
:   Name of the output file. Default is '-' (*stdout*).

-O, --overwrite
:   Allow an existing output file to be overwritten. Normally **osmium** will
    refuse to write over an existing file.

--output-header OPTION
:   Add output header option. This option can be given several times. See the
    *libosmium manual* for a list of allowed header options.

-v, --verbose
:   Set verbose mode. The program will output information about what it is
    doing to *stderr*.


# DIAGNOSTICS

**osmium renumber** exits with code 0 if everything went alright, it exits
with code 2 if there was a problem with the command line arguments,
and with exit code 1 if some other error occurred.


# EXAMPLES

Renumber a PBF file and output to a compressed XML file:

    osmium renumber -o ch.osm.bz2 switzerland.osm.pbf

Renumbering Switzerland currently (summer 2015) takes only about a minute and
needs a bit more than 2 GB RAM.
