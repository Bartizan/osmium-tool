Some rules for contributing to this project:

* Please open a separate issue for each problem, question, or comment you have.
  Do not re-use existing issues for other topics, even if they are similar. This
  keeps issues small and manageable and makes it much easier to follow through
  and make sure each problem is taken care of.
